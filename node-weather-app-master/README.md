## Description

Re-created a simple weather website using Node.js, Express, and Axios for submitting an API request to MapQuest and DarkSky to retrieve location information and the current weather, respectively.

### Deployed

This app is deployed to [Heroku](https://secret-cove-80282.herokuapp.com/).
//http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={Delhi}&limit={limit}&appid={API key}

### Note

You will need to sign up for an API key at [MapQuest](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/) and [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev) to use this app locally via your localhost. Create a `.env` file in the root folder to store your keys and access them using the `dotenv` package.

### Installing

After downloading or cloning the repo perform the following steps:

Open the project folder at the root in your terminal and run `npm install` to download the dependencies needed for this project.

Next, type `node src/app.js` to run the Express server which defaults to localhost:3000.
